   - Capture and compare screenshots for visual regression testing.
   - Use Playwright's tracing feature to debug complex test scenarios.

3. **Advanced Testing Techniques**:
   - Use Playwright's Fixtures to set up and tear down test environments efficiently.
   - Implement Component Object Models (COM) to organize and manage complex UI components.
   - Example:
   - Create reusable test components for common UI elements.
   - Use fixtures to manage test data and state across multiple test cases.
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated test execution.
   - Explore Playwright's network interception capabilities to mock API responses.
   - Leverage Playwright's built-in test runner for parallel test execution and reporting.
